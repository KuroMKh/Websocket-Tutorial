#Installation of Node.js
To begin, you'll need to install Node.js on your system. Follow these steps:

Download Node.js: Visit the official Node.js website here, and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.
Install Node.js: Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the installation instructions provided.
Verify Installation: After installation, open a command prompt or terminal window and type the following command to verify that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed:
bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
You should see version numbers for both Node.js and npm, indicating that they have been successfully installed.
Creating a Project Folder
Next, create a folder for your project. You can do this using your operating system's file explorer or the command line. For example, to create a project folder named my_project, navigate to your desired location in the command line and execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
Initializing a Node.js Project
Once your project folder is created, initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

bash
Copy code
npm init
This command will prompt you to enter various details about your project, such as its name, version, description, entry point, etc. You can press Enter to accept the default values or provide your own.

Installing the WebSocket Library
Now, you'll need to install the ws library, which provides WebSocket support for Node.js. To install it, run the following command in your project folder:

bash
Copy code
npm install ws
This will download and install the ws package and its dependencies into your project folder.

Feel free to customize and expand upon these instructions as needed for your specific project. If you have any questions or encounter any issues, refer to the official documentation for Node.js and the ws library for further assistance.
