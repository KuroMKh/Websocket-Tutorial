## WebSocket Webcam Streaming Project

This project aims to enable real-time webcam streaming over the web using WebSocket technology. Leveraging the power of Node.js and the WebSocket library, it facilitates seamless communication between the client and the server, allowing for efficient and low-latency transmission of webcam data.

### Features:
- Real-time Streaming: Transmit webcam data in real-time over the WebSocket connection, enabling live streaming capabilities.
- Efficient Communication: WebSocket protocol ensures efficient and lightweight communication between the client and the server, reducing latency and overhead.
- Node.js Backend: Utilizes Node.js as the backend environment to handle WebSocket connections, manage streaming sessions, and serve client requests.

### How It Works:
1) WebSocket Setup: The Node.js server sets up a WebSocket endpoint to establish bi-directional communication with the client.

2) Webcam Capture: The client-side application captures video data from the webcam using browser APIs such as getUserMedia.

3) Data Transmission: The captured webcam data is encoded and transmitted over the WebSocket connection to the server in real-time.

4) Server Processing: The Node.js server receives the webcam data, processes it if necessary, and broadcasts it to connected clients.
Client Display: Connected clients receive the webcam stream via WebSocket and display it in real-time on their devices.
